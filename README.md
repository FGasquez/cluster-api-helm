# cluster-api helm charts

Install [Cluster API (CAPI)](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/) manifests to
generate a fully working Kubernetes cluster for different providers.

Not all providers are implemented yet. We will be adding new providers as our
clients demand us. At this time, we provide the following charts:

* [openstack](./charts/capi-openstack)

We are planning to briefly add vsphere support.
